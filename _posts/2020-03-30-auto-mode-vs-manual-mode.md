  One of the first big mistakes people make when taking a photo from a moving vehicle is to not take their camera off of **"Auto" mode**.  Every camera is different so you might have to check with your camera documentation.  Some point and shoots don't really have a **"Manual"** mode to choose from.  In that case, you will want to find an icon that suggest movement - like a person running.  On a DSLR, you will want to switch into **"Shutter Priority"** mode or **"Manual"** mode.  (*"Tv"* for Canon or  *"S"* for Nikon and Sony).
 
  **Smarthphones** may or may not allow you to switch modes.  There are apps you can download that will allow **"Manual"** mode but what apps you can download depend on what phone you are using.
  
  
  #The biggest factors are **First: *Light***, and **Second: *Speed***.  
  
  ##All the rules of Photography still apply! 
  
  In fact, if you know how to take photographs of moving subjects, like cars, sports, etc, then you're already halfway there.  It's just a matter of adjusting your Shutter Speed up or down.  Ususally up!!  While you can take photos of people running, or birds flying at around 1/1000 or 1/1200, you are going to have to speed up to take photos of a bird sitting still on a telephone pole when you are driving by at 80mph.  I start around 1/2500 and go up or down - depending on quality of light and my other settings.
